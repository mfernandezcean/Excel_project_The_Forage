## Welcome to My Analytics Homebase

Join me on my data journey!

&nbsp; February of 2022, I began my journey to go from *zero* experience, to hired as a data analyst. In July of 2022 that dream became a reality- I am now a Tableau Consultant and Data Analyst at Zuar.  
What started as a fun experiment has grown into something much bigger than myself, which **you** may have ~~noticed~~ if you follow me on Tik Tok or LinkedIn!
